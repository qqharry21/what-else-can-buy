A browser extension that helps you make more informed purchasing decisions by converting product prices into your working hours. Ever wondered what else you could get for the price of a new smartphone or a daily coffee habit? This extension can help you find out!

## Features

- **Salary to Hourly Rate Calculator**: Convert your monthly salary into an hourly rate
- **Working Hours Calculator**: Calculate how many hours you need to work to afford a product
- **Shopping Website Integration**: Automatically detects product prices on shopping websites and shows the required working hours (Currently only supports Amazon)
- **Multi-currency Support**: Supports TWD, USD, and JPY currencies
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive sidebar interface for easy access
- **I18n Support**: Supports multiple languages (Currently only supports English and Traditional Chinese)

## How It Works

1. Enter your monthly salary in the extension sidebar
2. The extension calculates your hourly rate
3. When browsing products (especially on Amazon), the extension will:
   - Automatically detect product prices
   - Calculate and display how many working hours you need to afford the item
4. For other websites, you can manually enter product prices to calculate working hours

## Supported Currencies

- ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼ TWD (Taiwan Dollar)
- ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ USD (US Dollar)
- ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ JPY (Japanese Yen)
